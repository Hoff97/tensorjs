# Style transfer with TensorJS - [View](https://hoff97.github.io/tensorjs/examples/style/)

This is a small example application of TensorJS.
It allows the user to load an image and apply one
of 5 style transfer models.

Note that this is a more complex model. You should not
expect this to perform well, unless your Computer
has a suitable GPU.
Try it with smaller images first!
